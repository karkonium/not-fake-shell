//Sprint 1 Backlog.  
July 11 to July 17

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a) As a user I should be able to direct anything that a command outputs into a file
b) As a user, I should be able to see all directories including subdirectories in a path I specify
c) As a user, I should be able to move content from one location into another directory and delete the old content
d) As a user, I should be able to create a copy of a file and put it into a specified location
e). As a user, I should be able to create a copy of a directory and its subdirectories put it into a specified location
f). As a user I should be able to see the contents of any files on my screen
g). As a user I should be able to see the contents of multiple files on my screen
h). As a user I should be able to retrieve the contents of any file from a given URL and put it into my current working directory


These tasks are assigned as follows:
a-1 - implement singleton design by creating one file system instance
a-2 - make commands class an abstract class 
a-3 - add method to put command output into an outfile if provided using both ‘>’ and ‘>>’
a-4 - make sure outfile gets added to CWD if outfile is provided
b-1 - create a method that performs recursion on current directory in Tree class and return directory-type of new mini-tree with all subdirectories
b-2 - use above method in LS when prompted to display subdirectories of the tree it has
b-3 - create unit test cases for tree
c-1 - create MV class that completes the task of deleting content at old path and moving it to a new path
c-2 - create CRC card for MV class and make it subclass of CP 
c-3 - implement method to remove a node and everything in it
c-4 - use method described in b-1 and put mini-tree at NEWPATH 
c-5 -create unit test cases
d-1 - create crc card for CP class
d-2 - create CP class that completes the task of copying contents at path and putting it in new 
         path
d-3 - method that creates a new file with the same name and copies the contents into it
d-4 - use Tree class to ensure paths exist and are valid
d-5 - create unit test cases
e-1 - method that creates a new folder 
e-2 - uses method described in c-4 
e-3 - create unit test cases
f-1 - create unit test cases
g-1 - create unit test cases
h-1 - create get class, also create get CRC card
h-2 - create networking package that has network class, also create network CRC card
h-3 - create method that validates if the url provided leads to a .txt or .html file
h-4 - create unit test cases 
h-5 - implement method that takes the contents of the file from a URL and converts it into a string
h-6 - implement method that creates a file in cwd with the contents of the file provided by the URL
