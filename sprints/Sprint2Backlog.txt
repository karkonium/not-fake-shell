//Sprint 2 Backlog.  
July 18 to July 26

*Some tasks carried over from last sprint such as mv and cp class tasks*

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
As a user, I should be able to save my session before I quit
As a user, I should be able to start off from my last saved session if I want 
As a user, I should be able to find a file at a certain path
As a user, I should be able to find a folder at a certain path
As a user, I should be able to find a file at multiple different paths
As a user, I should be able to find a folder at multiple different paths
As a user, I should be able to see the contents of the entire file system 

These tasks are assigned as follows:
a-1 - create save class and implement method to convert java objects into XML file
a-2 - create unit test and test cases for save class
a-3 - add in CRC card for save class
a-4 - validate the user gives no arguments for this command
a-5 - add javadoc documentation to class
b-1 - create a method to load the last save state and implement method to convert XML file to 
         java objects
b-2 - create unit test and test cases for load class
b-3 - add in CRC card for load class
b-4 - validate the user gives no arguments for this command
b-5 - add javadoc documentation to class
c-1 - create find class as a subclass of commands class
c-2 - create unit test and test cases for find class
c-3 - add javadoc documentation to class
c-4 - ensure find checks that key letter of f is given to find a file, recursively in directory 
c-5 - ensure number of arguments given is valid for finding a file
d-1 - create a method to find folder in find class
d-2 - ensure find checks that key letter of d is given to find a file, recursively in directory 
d-3 - ensure number of arguments given is valid for finding a folder
e-1 - allow method above to check for directories in multiple directories  recursively (perhaps recursive method is a helper function called within for loop)
e-2 - create test cases
f-1 - allow method above to check for files in multiple directories recursively (perhaps recursive method is a helper function called within for loop)
f-2 - create test cases
g-1 - create tree class and implement method displaying entire file system contents in correct format
g-2 - create unit test and test cases for tree class
g-3 - add in CRC card for tree class
g-4 - create mock object for file system in order to test tree, as well as other commands
