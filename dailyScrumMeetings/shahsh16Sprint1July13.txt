What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- created get command
	- brainstormed how to deal with recursive nature of some new commands
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- cp and mv classes
	- cp and mv crc cards
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- how unit tests are going to work because we are running everything through contructors
