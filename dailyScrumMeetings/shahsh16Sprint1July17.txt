What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- no coding done due to midterm
	- brainstormed on paper how to work with recursive function
	- know how to implement get unit test
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- cp and mv classes
	- unit tests for classes
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- how unit tests are going to work because we are running everything through contructors
