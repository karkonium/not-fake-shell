What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- created most of code for ls
	- created code for FileIO
	- created code for Mkdir
	- added code to node, directorynode, and fileNode
	- fixed adding node code for tree
What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
	- finalizing code for ls
	- check over code/ test code
	- add exception code to exceptionrepository based on code i wrote
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- Confused on how current working directory will be passed to ls
