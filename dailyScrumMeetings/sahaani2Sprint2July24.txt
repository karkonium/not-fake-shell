What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- converted Commands to abstract class and added execute method
	- implemented execute for Cat, Cd, Echo and Find and tweaked code
	( did not commit to avoid errors in other commands)
	- created static flag class within commands to track flag arguments
	(I decided that this provided more utility than implementing a validator method)
	- made arguments an instance variable within commands
	
	
What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
	- making execute output a string
	- implementing execute for other commands
	- change argument validation
	- unit testing
	
	
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- not as of yet
