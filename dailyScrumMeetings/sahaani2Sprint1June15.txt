What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- brainstormed ideas for command parsing and command super class
	- no code implemented due to midterms
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- plan on implementing Command Class and command/argument parsing 
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- not as of right now
