What did I work on in the last three days?

	- converted all methods within Parser and FileIO to instance methods
	- created instances of FileIO and Parser where needed and replaced all static calls with 
	instance calls
	- added and completed unit test for Parser and Validator classes

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?

	- add validate option argument to validator class
