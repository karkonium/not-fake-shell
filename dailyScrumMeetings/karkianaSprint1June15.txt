What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on crc cards
    - brain stormed how to implement the log command
    - brain stormed where to use stack 
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Work on how to store the current directory user is in
	- Work on console IO class to allow incorrect inputs to be validated 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Whether to use a stack to store current directory or something more primitive
