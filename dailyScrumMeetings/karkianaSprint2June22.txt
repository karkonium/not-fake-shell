What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- implemented method that returns node for a given path
	- corrected addDirectoryNode and addFileNode so that they have a validation procedure prior to execution 
	- created MkDir class
What I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Finish MkDir class
	- Finish Stack feature of the shell
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- When to use try catch statements
