What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- created base code for man command
	- created base code for echo command (exchanged task with partner)
	- created base code for cat command
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- finalizing previous commands
	- adding assert/exception clauses
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- how directory path is going to work is a bit of a concern
