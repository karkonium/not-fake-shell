What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- created base code for Command class
	- created validateArgument method
	- completed Driver parse method
	- created Driver choose command method
What I plan to work in the next three days?
	- splitting parser and driver into separate classes (to avoid violation of SRP)
	- validation overriding for command subclasses to validate type of arguments in addition to #
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- slow on argument validation
