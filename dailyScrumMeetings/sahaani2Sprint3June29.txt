What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- worked on constructors for command classes
	- wrote validation methods for string, dir, filename and int arguments
What I plan to work in the next three days?
	- compress valodator and create children validation classes
	- remove static methods from Validate class
Am I blocked on anything?  
	- push and popd was implemented by Clement
